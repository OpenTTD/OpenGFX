# The minimum and maximum version of OpenTTD that supports this particular
# version of the content. If no version is given the minimum version is assumed
# to be 0.6.0 (the moment the content system was introduced) and there is no
# limit on the maximum version, i.e. all later versions are supported.
#
# Generally you should enter a minimum version and leave the maximum version
# empty as the vast majority of content would not be broken by newer versions.
#
# Valid versions are:
#  * stable release number, such as 1.2.1 and 1.0.0
#  * nightly revisions in the form: 1.3 r24680
#    in this case the 1.3 denotes the version number of the next major release,
#    which is normally deduced by getting the number of the last stable release
#    such as 1.2.1, removing the last digit so you get 1.2 and adding one to the
#    new last digit thus ending with 1.3. The r24680 is the revision of OpenTTD
#    that first supported your feature.
#
# It is preferred to use the nightly revision as that allows your content to
# be visible by the betas and release candidates of the stable release as well.

# A comma separated list of objects this content depends on.
# Each dependency is written using the following formula:
#  <type of content>:<unique ID>:<md5 sum>
# The type of content are the same type as you have to give for the type of this
# content, the unique ID is the four byte unique ID given to all content and the
# md5 sum is the md5 checksum that is generated for the content as uploaded to
# the content system. With these three parameters the dependencies will be
# resolved at the content server.
#
# The unique name is written in short four character text form or in a eight
# character hexadecimal form 13579ACF. You cannot mix these forms or use escape
# characeters. The md5 sum is written in the 32 character hexadecimal form.
#
# For example an AI using the four character text form:
#   dependencies = AI:WRAI:bd8c6ae3a92ce13a62f0913b6e8f8e5b
# and a NewGRF using the 8 character hexadecimal form:
#   dependencies = NewGRF:FBFB0102:803d38f242f016c4a8212fa05c0f9b7e

# For scenarios and heightmaps, provide the uniqueid which can be obtained from the
# bananas WebUI using this property. Note that you shouldn't make up the uniqueid.
# If your scenario/heightmap have not yet been uploaded to bananas, you must make
# an initial upload via the web interface in order to obtain the uniqueid.
#
# For content types other than Scenario and Heightmap this property has no effect
# at all.
#
# Example (hex):  (should have 8 symbols)
#   uniqueid = 00000A35
# Example (dec):  (should have no leading zeros)
#   uniqueid = 2613
